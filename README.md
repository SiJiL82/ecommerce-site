## Known Bugs
On pages that implement Cripsy Forms (such as the Request page), the top header extends off the right of the page, creating a horizontal scroll bar.  
The cause of this has not been found.  
# Future Developments
Customise the AllAuth account management forms (sign up, sign in etc.) so they fit the site style.
