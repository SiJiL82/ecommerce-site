# Ecommerce Site - Mini Sew N Sew
This project is an ecommerce site allowing the purchase of physical goods.
The site has bee configured to be a store front for my sister's real business - Mini Sew N Sew, as her existing site is lacking many features
she wanted to implement, and is unusable on mobile devices as the site is not responsive.  
This project aims to fix the existing issues she has, by implementing a fully responsive, fully customisable design that she can use and iterate
on in the future to improve her business prescence.

Inspiration for the site design and theme colours taken from the existing website https://www.minisewnsew.com/ however no code/modules etc. were taken from the site - this project was written from scratch just using the site themes and existing product imagery to populate the site, as it is going to be a direct replacement for the existing site.
